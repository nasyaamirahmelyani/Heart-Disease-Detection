The Heart Disease Detection
Project Description
The Heart Disease Detection project aims to develop a machine learning-based prediction system to identify the likelihood of heart disease. The model is designed to assist in early detection by analyzing clinical and patient-related features. This project can serve as a learning reference for data science, machine learning, and healthcare data analysis.

Dataset
The dataset contains patient medical records with several clinical features, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Maximum heart rate
- Other relevant clinical attributes
The dataset undergoes preprocessing before being used for model training.

Methodology
The main stages of this project include:
- Data Preprocessing: data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature normalization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): statistical analysis and visualization to understand data patterns.
- Feature Selection: selecting the most influential features.
- Modeling: applying machine learning algorithm using Logistic Regression for heart disease classification.
- Model Evaluation: evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.

Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

Objectives
- Build an accurate heart disease prediction model
- Analyze the impact of clinical features on heart disease
- Provide a machine learning project portfolio in the healthcare domain
